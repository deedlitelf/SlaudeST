    // You can muddle the string by, for example, adding 'A' to the end of the prefix, and 'r' to the start of the suffix
    // Which makes the text AClauder, which has a different token breakdown than Claude (Cla+ude -> AC+l+auder)

    // The weird � character is less supported, but the thought process was to make the thing seem like a leftover error and for the model to ignore it, "AClauder" doesn't make any sense after all. You can remove it to try it out or if you think anything weird is happening, but felt good to me.
